# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Zhen

I'm Zhen Tong, a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I'm passionate about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning, currently diving into ML for generative model and combinatorial optimization problems with Prof. Tianshu Yu. I was a software engineer intern for ML at Siemens in 2022. And now I work as a research assistant at LOGO Lab When I'm not coding, catch me shredding on a snowboard. Cheers!
