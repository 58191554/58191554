👋 Hi, I'm Zhen!

I'm Zhen Tong — a graduate student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, passionate about Deep Learning Systems, LLM infrastructure, and Reinforcement Learning. I enjoy building scalable AI systems, optimizing model performance, and diving deep into generative models.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon, and before that as an ML engineer at Siemens and a research assistant at LOGO Lab, focusing on generative modeling and optimization.

When I’m not coding, you can probably find me snowboarding or exploring new tech ideas. 🚀

🔬 Research & Interests

Large Language Model systems (MLX, vLLM-style engines, speculative decoding, GPU/Metal kernels)
